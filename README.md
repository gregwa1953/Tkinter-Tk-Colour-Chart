My Implementation of the standard Tkinter / Tk Colour chart

This is my implementation of the standard Tkinter/Tk colour chart that can be found at http://www.science.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Color_Charts_for_TKinter .  I created this as an example for my Learning Page book due to be published in early 2021.
